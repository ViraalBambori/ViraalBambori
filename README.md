I am a Developer Relations professional with a knack for JavaScript. I aim to empower the developer community by helping them find a place in the welcoming world of open source and explore the technology sector from a different perspective. I love sharing my ideas through my writings or by taking sessions, hosting conferences, or being around at tech events!


I recently started <a href="https://devrel.page">DevRel.Page</a>, an umbrella initiative to help students and early age professionals find their way into Developer Relations. I have been working as a DevRel consultant with various companies, including [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education), [@mlh](https://github.com/mlh), [@grouparoo](https://github.com/grouparoo), [@RocketChat](https://github.com/RocketChat) and many others! Notably, I have hosted some of the top international developer conferences like GitHub Universe, GitHub Satellite India, MLH Hackcon & Local Hack Day and have given multiple talks on open source development in 30+ institutes of India and abroad.
